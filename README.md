# Cymatica

Cymatica is an investigation of digital cymatics, see Richard Grillotti's thesis [Resonant Waves: Immersed in Geometry](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7745j4fh) for background. This repo is the home of:

- **[chladni](https://chladni.coilflow.com/)**: Javascript class, fast analog approximation, with features
- **[vrw](https://vector.coilflow.com)**: vector art generator
- **[shere](./investigations/sphere)** Cross-platform c++, for realtime modulation and projection

It is rumored that an old Cymatix video console was found at a flea market in Fairfield Iowa along with a [ZRanikov2](./investigations/sightings/02.png).
