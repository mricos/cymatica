# Cymatica

Cymatica is an investigation of digital cymatics, see Richard Grillotti's thesis [Resonant Waves: Immersed in Geometry](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7745j4fh) for background. This repo is the home of:

- **sphere**: barebones, cross-platform c++ pure 3D, good for projecting
- **chladni**: Javascript class, fast analog approximation, with features
- **chladni-v99**: vectorized display with sound (coming Nov 2023)
- 
It is rumored that an old Cymatix video console was found at a flea mark in Fairfield Iowa. This [shot](./investigatons/sightings/cymatix-001.png) looks promising.
