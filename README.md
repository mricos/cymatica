# Digital Cymatics

**Abstract:** Digital Cymatics is an evolution of the traditional study of making sound waves visible. Drawing inspiration from tools and techniques such as oscilloscopes, Chladni plates, and spherical harmonics, this dcoument introduces a modern approach to visualizing sound in the digital realm. At its core is a realtime sound processing engine called estovox. Esto

## Introduction

Cymatics, the study of visualizing sound waves, has a rich history with tools like oscilloscopes, which display electronic signals, and Chladni plates, which demonstrate patterns formed by sound vibrations on solid surfaces. Spherical harmonics further provide mathematical representations of sound waves on a sphere. Building on these foundational examples, this paper presents a digital approach to cymatics, emphasizing the role of the Nexus database and its associated components.

## System Components

The Coilflow System is composed of several key components:

- **Nexus:** A realtime database designed to handle rapid data changes and interactions. It serves as the central hub for data flow and interaction.
- **Estovox:** Communicates bidirectionally with Nexus.
- **Phaser:** Another component that has a bidirectional communication link with Nexus.
- **Helix:** Interacts unidirectionally with Nexus.
- **Photon:** Also interacts unidirectionally with Nexus.
- **Cymetica:** A specialized component that responds to changes in the Nexus database, generating visual representations of sound waves.
- **Realtime-js:** Communicates directly with Cymetica, facilitating real-time interactions.

## Conclusion

The Coilflow System offers a groundbreaking approach to digital cymatics. By drawing inspiration from traditional tools like oscilloscopes and Chladni plates and integrating modern technology, it provides a seamless and interactive experience for visualizing sound waves in real-time.
