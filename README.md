# Cymatica

Cymatica is an investigation of digital cymatics, see Richard Grillotti's thesis [Resonant Waves: Immersed in Geometry](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7745j4fh) for background. This repo is the home of:

- [[shere](./sphere) barebones, cross-platform c++, good for projection
- **[chladni](https://chladni.coilflow.com/)**: Javascript class, fast analog approximation, with features
- **[photon](https://phonton.coilflow.com/)**: vectorized display in Rust


It is rumored that an old Cymatix video console was found at a flea market in Fairfield Iowa along with a [ZRanikov2](./investigations/sightings/02.png).
