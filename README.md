# Digital Cymatics

**Abstract:** Digital cymatics is an evolution of the traditional study of making sound waves visible. Drawing inspiration from tools and techniques such as oscilloscopes, Chladni plates, and spherical harmonics, this dcoument introduces an approach to visualizing sound in the digital realm.

## Introduction

Cymatics, the study of visualizing sound waves, has a rich history with tools like oscilloscopes, which display electronic signals, and Chladni plates, which demonstrate patterns formed by sound vibrations on solid surfaces. Spherical harmonics further provide mathematical representations of sound waves on a sphere. Building on these foundational examples, this paper presents a digital approach to cymatics, emphasizing the role of the vector graphics as a means of visual representation.
