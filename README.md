# Cymatica

Cymatica is an investigation of digital cymatics, see Richard Grillotti's thesis [Resonant Waves: Immersed in Geometry](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7745j4fh) for background. This repo is the home of:

- **sphere**: barebones, cross-platform c++, good for projection
- **[chladni](https://chladni.coilflow.com/)**: Javascript class, fast analog approximation, with features
- **[chladni-v99](https://chladni-v99.coilflow.com/)**: vectorized display with sound (coming 2024)

It is rumored that an old Cymatix video console was found at a flea market in Fairfield Iowa. Same vendor is selling a knock-off [ZRanikov2](./investigations/sightings/02.png), fingers crossed.
