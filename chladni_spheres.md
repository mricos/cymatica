At their core, both Chladni patterns and atomic orbitals arise from the solutions to wave equations under specific boundary conditions.


## Chladni's Plates

**Wave Equation**: The patterns seen on Chladni's plates are solutions to the classical wave equation for a vibrating plate.

**Boundary Conditions**: The edges of the plate are typically held fixed, preventing any movement. This creates a boundary condition where the displacement of the plate (the amplitude of the wave) must be zero at the edges.

**Chladni Patterns**: When the plate is vibrated at a specific frequency, the sand or powder sprinkled on the plate moves to areas where the plate is not vibrating. These areas of no vibration (nodal lines) form patterns that are determined by the shape of the plate and the frequency of vibration. Different frequencies give rise to different patterns.

## Chladni equations
Chladni patterns emerge from the study of the vibrations of elastic plates. The governing equation for these patterns is the two-dimensional wave equation for a thin plate, which can be expressed as:

$$
\nabla^2 u - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$
Where:
- $ u(x, y, t) $ is the displacement of the plate at position $ (x, y) $ and time $ t $.
- \( c \) is the speed of the wave in the plate, which depends on the material properties of the plate and its thickness.

The boundary conditions are that the displacement $u$ is zero at the edges of the plate (assuming the edges are clamped):

$$
u(\text{edge}, t) = 0
$$

When the plate is vibrated at specific frequencies, standing wave patterns can form. For these standing waves, the time dependence can be separated out, leading to spatial patterns (modes) that are sinusoidal in time:

$$
u(x, y, t) = U(x, y) \sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$

Where:
- $ U(x, y) $ is the spatial pattern of the mode (which corresponds to the Chladni pattern).
- $ \omega $ is the angular frequency of vibration.
- $\phi $ is a phase constant.

The Chladni patterns specifically correspond to the nodal lines of the modes $ U(x, y)$ — the places where the plate does not move and where the sand or powder accumulates.

To find the actual patterns $ U(x, y) $ for a specific plate shape and boundary conditions, one would need to solve the wave equation with the given boundary conditions, which often requires numerical methods or specific analytical techniques for regular plate shapes (like circles or rectangles).



## Spherical harmonics

A spherical harmonic is a special type of function defined on the surface of a sphere. Mathematically, they arise from the solution to the angular part of the [Laplace equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation) in spherical coordinates. They are solutions the the Schrodinger equation and give rise to [atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital).

**Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions for atomic orbitals come from the physical requirements of the wavefunction. The wavefunction must be finite, single-valued, and continuous. Additionally, it must go to zero as the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity.

**Orbital Shapes**: Different quantum numbers (n, l, m) give rise to different shapes of atomic orbitals. The nodal surfaces (regions where the probability of finding an electron is zero) in these orbitals are analogous to the nodal lines in Chladni patterns.
Observations and Connections:

**Nodal Patterns**: Just as Chladni patterns have nodal lines where the plate does not vibrate, atomic orbitals have nodal surfaces where the probability of finding an electron is zero.

**Frequency and Energy**: In Chladni plates, changing the frequency of vibration changes the pattern. Similarly, in atoms, changing the energy (by changing quantum numbers) changes the shape of the orbital.

**Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions determine the possible patterns in both systems. In Chladni plates, the fixed edges dictate the patterns. In atoms, the behavior of the wavefunction at infinity and near the nucleus dictates the possible shapes of orbitals.

**Quantization**: Chladni patterns only appear at certain discrete frequencies. Similarly, atomic orbitals are quantized states of an electron in an atom, with discrete energy levels.

**Wave Equation**: Atomic orbitals arise from the solutions to the Schrödinger equation, a quantum mechanical wave equation.

### Schrödinger Equation

1. **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)**:

   $$
   \hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi(\mathbf{r})
 $$
   Where $ \hat{H} $ is the Hamiltonian operator, $ \psi(\mathbf{r}) $ is the wave function (which depends on position but not time), and $ E $ is the energy eigenvalue.

2. **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)**:
   This equation describes the evolution of the quantum state of a system over time. It's given by:
$$
   i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$
   Where $ i$ is the imaginary unit, $ \hbar $ is the reduced Planck constant, $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) $ is the time-dependent wave function, and $ \hat{H} $ is again the Hamiltonian operator.

For systems that are not exposed to external time-dependent potentials (like a time-varying electric field), the solutions to the TDSE can be expressed as a product of the spatial part (solutions to the TISE) and a time-evolution part. Specifically:
$$
\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \psi(\mathbf{r}) e^{-iEt/\hbar}
$$
Where $ \psi(\mathbf{r})$ are the stationary states (eigenfunctions) of the system, and $E$ are the corresponding energy eigenvalues. The factor$ $e^{-iEt/\hbar}$ describes the phase evolution over time.

**A word about phase**:
As $E$ increases, the phase term $iEt/\hbar$ increases which is to say an increase of energy causes a simultaneous increase in frequency and decrease is spatial wavelength of the vibrating medium. Using phase to describe frequency like this also accounts for the interfernce bands seen in the double split experiement.



In essence, both systems showcase the general principle that waves, whether they represent sound in a plate or the probability distribution of an electron in an atom, will form patterns determined by the governing wave equation and imposed boundary conditions.
